Kawai notes: When in Normal or Twin, Resonance only goes 0..3

You can't set mute as a parameter change.  So when you set mute, Edisyn will just tell the synth to turn the volume (VCA Envelope Level) to 0 for that source.  Further, if you write a patch with mute set, Edisyn will write the patch with the mute unset, but zero the volume.

This strategy works fine if your patch didn't have mute already set on the synth when you loaded it into Edisyn.  But if mute is set on the synth, then Edisyn can't do anything about when you change the mute value: it'll still be muted on the synth until you send or write the patch.  Long story short: when loading a patch, make sure it's entirely unmuted to avoid confusion.

The DCF Envelope Sustain actually goes from 0...100. But on the machine it is (incorrectly) displayed as going from -50 to 50.

When you do a send, the name isn't updated (it stays as it was), but the sound is updated.


<h1>Waldorf Blofeld</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Waldorf Blofeld,</b> the <b>Waldorf Blofeld with SL Option,</b> and the <b>Waldorf Blofeld Keyboard</b> (which automatically comes with the SL option).

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set your Blofeld to send <b>Sysex only</b>, not <b>Ctl</b> nor <b>Ctl+Sysex</b>.  Also make sure that <b>Ctrl Receive</b> is on.

<p><b>SL Option</b> The SL option gives you the option of specifying a <b>sound sample</b> instead of a <b>wave</b> on Oscillators 1 and 2. This is turned on by choosing a <b>Sample Bank</b> in the editor: then the wave menu turns into a sample menu.  You turn it off by choosing <b>None</b> in the Sample Bank.  

<p><b>Gotchas</b> Only two at present:

<ul>
<li>
If you load the current patch, the Blofeld does not tell Edisyn what bank or number the patch is.  Edisyn will leave synced mode.
<p><li>
If you send a patch, or modify its parameters, the Blofeld's patch screen does not indicate that it's been edited (as it usually does with a little inverted "E"), even though it has in fact been edited.
</ul>
