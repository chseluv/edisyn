Unfortunately drums don't have their own effects/output, nor submix channel: they will use whatever effect/output and submix channel the current single or multi patch is using.

Bug in Kawai K4 -- it doesn't return the MIDI channel when it does a dump.

<h1>Waldorf Blofeld</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Waldorf Blofeld,</b> the <b>Waldorf Blofeld with SL Option,</b> and the <b>Waldorf Blofeld Keyboard</b> (which automatically comes with the SL option).

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set your Blofeld to send <b>Sysex only</b>, not <b>Ctl</b> nor <b>Ctl+Sysex</b>.  Also make sure that <b>Ctrl Receive</b> is on.

<p><b>SL Option</b> The SL option gives you the option of specifying a <b>sound sample</b> instead of a <b>wave</b> on Oscillators 1 and 2. This is turned on by choosing a <b>Sample Bank</b> in the editor: then the wave menu turns into a sample menu.  You turn it off by choosing <b>None</b> in the Sample Bank.  

<p><b>Gotchas</b> Only two at present:

<ul>
<li>
If you load the current patch, the Blofeld does not tell Edisyn what bank or number the patch is.  Edisyn will leave synced mode.
<p><li>
If you send a patch, or modify its parameters, the Blofeld's patch screen does not indicate that it's been edited (as it usually does with a little inverted "E"), even though it has in fact been edited.
</ul>
