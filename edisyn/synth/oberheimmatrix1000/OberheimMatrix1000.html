<h1>Oberheim Matrix 1000</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Oberheim Matrix 1000</b>.  Though they are very similar, the <b>Matrix 6/6r</b> will not work with this patch editor (yet).  Someone will have to modify it (note: I'm presently using the patch name to extract the bank number; that won't work on the 6/6r).

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Make sure that Memory Protect is off (see page 36 of the manual). 

<p><b>Sending Parameters Bug</b> The Matrix 1000 has a command which receives a dump of parameters and stores them in working memory (Edisyn's "Send" procedure).  Unfortunately it seems to corrupt the working memory, so some parameters do not operate correctly.  But Edisyn still needs to Send!  Edisyn uses sending for hill-climbing, merging, mutation, undo/redo, etc.  So instead of sending to working memory, Edisyn will <b>write</b> to patch 199 and then read patch 199 into working memory.  This means that if you are editing a patch, patch 199 will be constantly overwritten.  So don't use it.  [If you're editing patch 199, it'll probably work fine, but that's an exception].

<p><b>Suggestions</b>

<ul>
<li>If you add a lot of random noise (like >50%) to the Matrix 1000, it will often fall silent.  This is almost always due to randomization of either the Amplifier section or the Amplifier Envelope (Envelope 2).  I suggest that you first edit the mutation parameters to remove these sections as mutation candidates.
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b> 

<ul>
<li>The original ROM (1.1.1) for the Matrix 1000 can't handle real-time updates very fast: it clogs up quickly.  If you have one of these machines, you should turn off <b>Sends Real Time Changes</b> in the <b>MIDI</b> menu.  Alternatively you can upgrade your ROM to a better one.  There are two options, 1.1.6 and 1.2.0.  I suggest 1.2.0, which I think is somewhat better.  If you are in Europe, you can buy the ROM (it's quite cheap) through Untergeek:

<ul><li><b>http://www.untergeek.de/howto/oberheim-matrix-1000/oberheim-matrix-1000-firmware-v1-20/</b>  
</ul>

<p>If you are in the USA, you can buy the ROM through Bob Grieb (the author):
<ul><li><b>http://tauntek.com/contact-information.htm</b>
</ul>

<p>Note that even with a new ROM, the Matrix 1000 still will be slightly pokey in keeping up with certain parameters.  But it's <i>far</i> better than the original ROM.
<p><li>
The patch editor allows you to give patches a name.  This is backwards-compatible with the 6/6r.  However, when you store a patch in the Matrix 1000, your name is not stored.  Instead if you request the patch again, it'll come back with the name <b>BNK<i>b</i>: <i>nn</i></b>, where <b><i>b</i></b> is the bank number, and <b><i>nn</i></b> is the two-digit patch number.
</ul>
