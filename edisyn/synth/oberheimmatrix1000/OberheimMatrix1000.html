<h1>Oberheim Matrix 1000</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Oberheim Matrix 1000</b>.  Though they are very similar, the <b>Matrix 6/6r</b> will not work with this patch editor (yet).  Someone will have to modify it (note: I'm presently using the patch name to extract the bank number; that won't work on the 6/6r).

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Make sure that Memory Protect is off (see page 36 of the manual). 

<p><b>Gotchas</b> 

<ul>
<li>The original ROM (1.1.1) for the Matrix 1000 can't handle real-time updates very fast: it clogs up quickly.  If you have one of these machines, you should turn off <b>Sends Real Time Changes</b> in the <b>MIDI</b> menu.  Alternatively you can upgrade your ROM to a better one.  There are two options, 1.1.6 and 1.2.0.  I suggest 1.2.0, which I think is somewhat better.  If you are in Europe, you can buy the ROM (it's quite cheap) through Untergeek:

<ul><li><b>http://www.untergeek.de/howto/oberheim-matrix-1000/oberheim-matrix-1000-firmware-v1-20/</b>  
</ul>

<p>If you are in the USA, you can buy the ROM through Bob Grieb (the author):
<ul><li><b>http://tauntek.com/contact-information.htm</b>
</ul>

<p>Note that even with a new ROM, the Matrix 1000 still will be slightly pokey in keeping up with certain parameters.  But it's <i>far</i> better than the original ROM.
<p><li>
The patch editor allows you to give patches a name.  This is backwards-compatible with the 6/6r.  However, when you store a patch in the Matrix 1000, your name is not stored.  Instead if you request the patch again, it'll come back with the name <b>BNK<i>b</i>: <i>nn</i></b>, where <b><i>b</i></b> is the bank number, and <b><i>nn</i></b> is the two-digit patch number.
</ul>
